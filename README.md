## Overview
* In Covid 19 Mask Detector we used OpenCV, Tensorflow/Keras, and Deep Learning.
* It can automatically detect whether people in the image are wearing masks or not.
* Our goal is to train a custom deep learning model to detect whether people in the image are wearing a mask or not.

## Motivation
* In these difficult times of pandemic, there is a growing need to wear a mask.
* But many people have started neglecting the necessity of a mask.
* A mask not only protects the wearer, but also stops the transmission of the deadly virus.
* So, our model will help us to keep a check on the people whether they are wearing a mask or not.

## Libraries used
* OpenCV
* Tensorflow/Keras
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
